# Exam Pattern Recognition Feature

## Overview
The Exam Pattern Recognition feature enables the AI learning platform to analyze past exams to identify recurring patterns, question formats, topic distributions, and difficulty levels. These patterns can then be incorporated into quiz generation to create more authentic and exam-like questions. By presenting these patterns in a dedicated, visually impressive interface, the platform helps reduce exam anxiety and builds student confidence through transparent insights into exam structures.

## Business Value
- **Improved Quiz Relevance**: Generate quizzes that more closely mimic actual exam formats
- **Targeted Learning**: Help students prepare for specific testing formats they'll encounter
- **Predictive Analysis**: Identify recurring topics and concepts that frequently appear on exams
- **Enhanced Preparation**: Better prepare students for actual exam conditions and question styles
- **Reduced Exam Anxiety**: Give students confidence by demystifying exam patterns
- **Data-Driven Learning**: Enable evidence-based study strategies focused on high-yield topics
- **Metacognitive Support**: Help students understand "how exams work" in their specific courses

## Feature Components

### 1. Pattern Entity & Database
- Create a new `patterns` table in the database linked to past exam files
- Store patterns in a flexible, visualization-friendly format with normalized values
- Capture statistical insights that can be presented through various chart types
- Implement proper row-level security policies consistent with the existing data model

### 2. Pattern Recognition Process
- Allow users to upload past exam files (with reasonable size limits)
- Use AI to analyze the content and extract actionable patterns such as:
  - Question formats (multiple choice, open-ended, calculation-based)
  - Topic distribution and frequency with percentage representation
  - Difficulty progression throughout the exam
  - Common keywords and terminologies with importance scores
  - Typical problem structures and recurring question frameworks
  - Time allocation suggestions based on question complexity
  - High-value study areas based on point distribution
- Store the analyzed patterns with references to the source exam(s)
- Include confidence scores for each detected pattern to indicate reliability

### 3. Quiz Generation Integration
- Add a "Use Exam Patterns" checkbox in the quiz generation dialog
- When selected, incorporate relevant patterns from past exams into the quiz prompt
- Allow selection of specific patterns to use when multiple are available
- Prioritize patterns from the selected subject areas when applicable

### 4. Dedicated Patterns Management Page
- Create a standalone, dedicated "Exam Patterns" page in the dashboard
- Implement an engaging, information-rich interface that immediately demonstrates value
- Use modern data visualization components (charts, heatmaps, radar plots) to represent patterns
- Include filtering capabilities by course, year, semester, and exam type
- Provide comparative views to identify trends across multiple exams
- Enable pattern sharing within workspaces

### 5. Anxiety-Reducing UI Elements

- Create "What to Expect" summaries that outline predicted exam structure
- Develop personalized study recommendations based on pattern analysis
- Include success stories and testimonials about pattern-based preparation
- Use calming color schemes and supportive messaging throughout the interface

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS patterns (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  past_exam_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES past_exams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  workspace_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES workspaces(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  pattern_data JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  confidence_score DECIMAL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.7,
  usage_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_patterns_past_exam_id ON patterns(past_exam_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_patterns_workspace_id ON patterns(workspace_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_patterns_user_id ON patterns(user_id);

-- Set up row level security policies
ALTER TABLE patterns ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Pattern Data Model (TypeScript)
```typescript
export interface Pattern {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  past_exam_id: string;
  workspace_id: string;
  user_id: string;
  pattern_data: {
    // Question format distribution (normalized to percentages)
    question_formats: {
      multiple_choice: number; // Percentage
      short_answer: number;
      calculation: number;
      essay: number;
      other: number;
    };
    
    // Topic distribution with normalized weights
    topic_distribution: Record<string, {
      frequency: number; // Percentage
      average_points: number;
      importance_score: number; // Calculated based on frequency and points
    }>;
    
    // Exam structure information
    exam_structure: {
      section_breakdown: Record<string, number>; // Section name -> percentage of exam
      time_allocation_suggestions: Record<string, number>; // Topic -> minutes
      difficulty_progression: {
        beginning: string; // 'easy', 'medium', 'hard'
        middle: string;
        end: string;
      };
    };
    
    // Actionable insights for study focus
    key_insights: {
      high_value_topics: string[]; // Topics with best point/question ratio
      common_keywords: {word: string, importance: number}[];
      recurring_concepts: {concept: string, frequency: number}[];
      format_specific_tips: Record<string, string[]>; // Question format -> tips
    };
    
    // Confidence metrics for visualization
    confidence_metrics: {
      overall_exam_predictability: number; // 0-1 score
      topic_prediction_confidence: Record<string, number>; // Topic -> confidence score
      format_prediction_confidence: number;
    };
    
    // Statistical information useful for visualization
    meta_statistics: {
      average_questions_per_topic: number;
      topic_coverage_breadth: number; // 0-1 score
      topic_coverage_depth: number; // 0-1 score
      total_topics_identified: number;
      average_points_per_question_type: Record<string, number>;
    };
  };
  confidence_score: number; // Overall confidence in pattern accuracy
  usage_count: number;
  active: boolean;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### AI Prompt Integration
Extend the existing quiz generation prompt to include pattern information:

```
// When patterns are enabled
prompt += this.getPatternSection(selectedPatterns);

private getPatternSection(patterns: Pattern[]): string {
  if (!patterns || patterns.length === 0) return '';
  
  let patternPrompt = `
  
EXAM PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
Based on analysis of past exams, incorporate these patterns into the generated quiz to create an authentic exam experience:
`;

  patterns.forEach(pattern => {
    // Format question type distribution
    patternPrompt += `\n- Question types distribution: ${this.formatDistribution(pattern.pattern_data.question_formats)}`;
    
    // Add high-priority topics based on exam frequency
    patternPrompt += `\n- Prioritize these high-value topics: ${this.getHighValueTopics(pattern.pattern_data.topic_distribution)}`;
    
    // Add difficulty progression guidance
    patternPrompt += `\n- Follow this difficulty progression: ${this.formatDifficultyCurve(pattern.pattern_data.exam_structure.difficulty_progression)}`;
    
    // Add key terminology and concepts to incorporate
    patternPrompt += `\n- Include these key concepts and terminology: ${this.formatRecurringConcepts(pattern.pattern_data.key_insights.recurring_concepts)}`;
  });
  
  return patternPrompt;
}
```
